# Governance: `.doc-governance.json`

## Model

Each non-ignored Markdown, including untracked, is `loaded`, `active`, `routed`, `history`, `derived`, or
`governance`. Only loaded is size-limited; others need location/retrieval/lifecycle. History is append-only;
derived has rebuild; `requires_inbound` is evidence-only.

Cross-repo pointers: `external_reference_targets` declares reference targets that live in sibling repos.
An exact-target match that fails to resolve is skipped instead of flagged, and the declaration is itself
audited — a target that exists here, or one no reference uses, is a finding — so a suppression cannot outlive
its pointer. Prefixes and globs are deliberately absent: they would silence whole trees.

## CLI

- `find <query>`: H1 preamble/H2 (history: top bullet), five 240-byte hits max, `file-preamble` without H2,
  at most two hits per file. **H2 is the retrieval unit — a heading buried at H3 is body text, worth a tenth
  of a title hit. Put what must be findable at H2.**
  stdout ≤8 KiB, hit/miss/error 0/1/2.
- `audit [--shadow|--ship]`: clean/findings/error 0/1/2; shadow findings 0; ship starts
  `doc-governance: OK|FINDINGS|BROKEN`; xref findings/error 0/2.
- `report`: measure; `record-path`: path/ID/heading.

`--root`: Git toplevel default. No network/index; find is pointer-free; xrefs checked.

## Lifecycle

New history: `docs/archive/{decisions,dead-ends,milestones}-YYYY-MM.md` / `## 事件記錄（event-time）`;
`D/X/M-YYYYMMDD-slug`; title/ID/shard dates match; metadata `日期來源`/`放棄`/`重議`/`關聯`.
Committed records are immutable; reversal adds `supersedes:<ID>`.

`STATUS.md`: active, restartable paused, history/backlog routes, transfer readiness. Backlog: its class declares
`governed_sections`; matching sections contain open `B-*` only, and removal needs a citing D/X/M record.

`status_schema.active_item_contract` is optional, so adopted repos opt in deliberately and legacy configs keep their
existing shape. The object has exactly `required_fields` (a non-empty unique string list) and `uniform_fields` (a
unique subset of required fields). When enabled, every active work item is an H3 with non-empty bold bullet fields;
active prose outside an H3 is a finding, while an otherwise empty active section may contain only
`目前無進行中項目。` plus Markdown `---` section separators. A completed H3 (`✅` or `已完成`) is a finding. The portable coordination profile requires
`Writer`, `Workspace`, `Write Scope`, and `Dossier Steward`, with `Dossier Steward` uniform across active items and
never `unassigned`. Workspace stores a portable branch identity, `external/no-repo-write`, or `unassigned`—never an
absolute worktree path.

One plan/work item: edit `draft/approved/in-progress`; freeze `implemented/superseded`. Superseded needs
`取代計畫: <path>`. No `-v2/-final/-revised`. Legacy blobs are frozen and excluded from `find`, except
config-listed requirement sources.

## Surface budget

`governance_max_bytes` is a maintenance ceiling, not a correctness ratchet. Correctness and safety fixes may
move it to the next round binary tier; new capabilities must justify their surface cost. Never add only the
bytes needed by the current patch. `governance-ratio` stays informational because growing the Markdown
denominator would otherwise loosen the gate without simplifying governance.
