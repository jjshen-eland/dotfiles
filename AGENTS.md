# Agent Contract

這份檔案是本 repo 對**任何** agent（Claude Code / Codex / 其他）的行為契約。Clone 下來就生效，
不需要安裝任何工具，也不依賴任何人的個人設定或 skill。

分兩層：**Safety floor** 是你在任何 repo 的行為下限，不因任何 repo 的慣例而放寬（更嚴的規定往上疊）；
**Fallback conventions** 則是「這個 repo 沒有自己的規定時才適用」——它有，就照它的。
分界判準是**錯了會產出什麼**：多開一條本地 branch 完全可逆、不留錯誤產物；用錯 commit 格式
則直接產出必須重寫的東西。前者是安全，後者是慣例。

## Kernel

### Safety floor — never relaxed by any repo

- **NEVER commit onto the default branch** (`main`/`master`). If `HEAD` is on it — or detached — create a feature branch first: `git switch -c <type>/<slug>`. This holds regardless of protection state and regardless of which tooling is loaded.
- **NEVER push without authorization for the push in front of you.** Implementing, fixing, or committing never carries it, and neither does approval given before this change existed. **Where a shipping workflow applies, its authorization table is the only source — NEVER extend it with synonyms of your own.** Where none applies, authorization is an instruction naming the action itself ("push", "open a PR"), or an affirmative answer to a confirmation you just presented. **A bare "ship it" / "送出" names an outcome, not an action — on its own it authorizes nothing**; present the confirmation and wait. Deciding for yourself which wording is close enough is the failure this rule exists to prevent. No authorization ever covers the default branch.
- **NEVER merge on your own.** "push" or "open a PR" alone does NOT include merge. Only an explicit merge instruction does.
- **NEVER `git add -A` / `git add .` / `commit -a`.** Stage explicit paths.
- **If the working tree holds changes you did not make, STOP and report before staging, committing, or building on top of them.** Whether two sessions may share one tree is a dispatch decision made above you — never resolve it locally by guessing which changes are yours. Once authorized, explicit paths are still whole-file: stage verified hunks with `git add -p`.
- **Inspect `git diff --cached` before every commit.** After splitting a mixed file, verify from a clean clone — `git clone --no-local <repo> <tmpdir>`. "I checked the working tree" is not evidence.

### Shared work and durable project state

- **Do NOT create a dossier or decision store that the repo has not adopted.** When an existing active-state store is present, record the success criteria for non-trivial work before implementation; when both a governance config and its scanner exist, use that adopted lifecycle, when neither exists follow the repo's legacy store, and when only one exists STOP as broken adoption.
- **One writer per work item.** Parallel writers require a separate branch/worktree and disjoint declared write scopes. If durable state names another writer or the scope/ownership is ambiguous, STOP and get a reassignment instead of self-claiming.
- Shared active state, backlog, history shards, and shared plans have exactly one **Dossier Steward**. Only that steward edits those surfaces; isolated workers and reviewers remain read-only there, and reviewers never self-promote into writers.
- An isolated worker returns a **Dossier delta** containing its work item, actor, branch/workspace, commit SHA, changed scope/files, tests, progress, decisions with reasons, dead ends, blockers, and next step. The steward verifies those claims against the commit and tests before integrating them or updating canonical state.
- Record durable decisions, dead ends, and milestones at event time, not reconstructed at shipping time. With parallel workers, report the fact immediately to the steward; the steward is the sole writer to shared history.
- The steward integrates verified worker commits with `git cherry-pick` on a feature integration branch, never with a merge commit. Remove completed items from active state, write milestones to the repo's existing history store, and pass its documentation audit before declaring integration complete.
- Ownership transfer requires explicit user direction or a handoff from the current steward, followed by a durable-state update before the new steward writes. A checkpoint or handoff artifact is evidence, never a lock or authority to mutate the repository.
- **Runtime-local memory is a non-authoritative cache, never a prerequisite.** Safety/Git rules, cross-runtime agreements, project facts/state, cross-host continuity, and action authorization must not exist only there. Route shared behavior to native instructions and project facts/state to the repo's adopted authority; whether any runtime memory is on, off, unavailable, or differently configured must not change correctness, safety, or transfer readiness. Authorization never survives a session or ownership transfer.


### Fallback conventions — this repo's own convention wins where it has one

- Conventional Commits: `<type>: <short desc>`, type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`. **If this repo mandates another commit format, follow the repo.**
- Record non-obvious trade-offs, rejected alternatives, and dead ends **where this repo already keeps them**. Skip whenever the diff alone recovers the rationale — a rejected path leaves no trace in the diff, an added gate does. **If the repo has no such store, do NOT create one; list them in your report instead.**

## 文檔檢索路由

查 repo 的決策、死路、里程碑、規範、plan、skill reference 或 eval 時，先執行
`scripts/doc-governance.py find '<自然語言問題或 stable ID>'`；不要先整批讀 archive，也不要把人工 pointer
當成可檢索性的代理。寫入與生命週期規則見 `docs/document-governance.md`。

## Documentation authority

衝突時照這張表判，不要憑「哪份看起來比較新」。

| Kind of fact | Authority | On conflict |
|---|---|---|
| Agent behaviour, git discipline | this file's **Kernel** | Nothing may relax the safety floor. A repo may only be **stricter** |
| Repo conventions, architecture, commands | `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`（root，其次最接近改動位置的那份） | 最近者勝 |
| Active / paused project state | `STATUS.md`（若有） | 只留仍有效狀態與 history/backlog 入口 |
| Decisions, dead ends, milestones（**歷史**） | `docs/archive/{decisions,dead-ends,milestones}-YYYY-MM.md`（若 repo 已採用） | 以 event-time record 追加；legacy repo 依其既有權威 |
| Debt & known gaps（**未結案待辦**） | `docs/backlog.md`（若有） | 解決或放棄時移除並寫 history record |
| Install & usage for humans | `README.md` | |
| Dated plans | `docs/plans/*.md`（若有） | 每個 work item 一檔：draft／approved／in-progress 可原檔修訂，implemented／superseded 後凍結 |
| Handover | `docs/transfer.md`（若有） | 移交期間才存在 |
| **Generated / derived docs**（codegen、API dump、LLM 產的 repo map／wiki） | **none — descriptive only** | 見下 |

**Generated docs never win.** 與上表任一列衝突時，權威檔為準、generated 那份就是 stale——
**重新生成它，NEVER 改 generated 檔來贏一場爭論**。每個 generated artifact 都必須寫明自己的
重建指令；沒有重建指令的一律當作不可信。

**Rules are stated in exactly one place.** If a rule is needed elsewhere, point at it; do not restate it.
When always-on readers load different files, prefer a runtime-native import whose expansion has a clean-room behavior
eval; a textual pointer is not an import and cannot make an unloaded rule fire. If no verified import exists, keep the
necessary replicas short and machine-check drift. The kernel block plus root Claude import is the managed instance of
this pattern. Everything else points.

## Working discipline

- **Bug fix: write a reproducing test first, then fix.** 無法可行地自動重現者（環境相依、外部服務行為）
  改記手動重現步驟與修後驗證方式；「先重現、再修」的順序不變。
- **Ambiguous task: NEVER silently pick one reading.** 列出可能的解讀讓人選，不要為了維持動能而假設。
- **Irreversible or outward-facing actions require authorization that names the action**——push、發信、
  對外送出、刪除。已明說就別再問一次；未明說、或授權其實是針對更早的另一批工作，都停下確認。
- **Solo repo is not a lighter process.**「只有我一個人」「反正也沒保護」都不是放寬上述任何一條的理由。
- 為什麼 kernel 要求 clean clone 驗證：混檔誤收**在磁碟上恆綠**，只有乾淨 clone 看得見；
  人工看 staged diff 已實證失敗過三次，不能取代它。

## Repo specifics

<!-- 安裝到其他 repo 時，這一節整段重填；上面三個 managed block 由工具維護，不要手改 -->

- **測試**：`./tests/run.sh`，**以 exit code 判綠紅**（接 pipeline 會吃掉失敗）。
  改動 `scripts/`、setup 腳本、skill 腳本後必跑；改動任何 `.md` 的節名或搬動權威內容後同樣要跑
  （交叉引用 gate 掃全 repo 的 md）。
  Root `CLAUDE.md` 以原生 import 載入本檔，不再複製這三行；G1c clean-room 守 import 行為。
  各 gate 的判準、反例與設計理由（**放寬判準前必讀**）見 `docs/testing-contract.md`。
- **本 repo 的額外約束**：`~/.dotfiles` 同時是多台機器的部署來源，`scripts/` 底下的改動會經
  `dotsync` / `brewup` 散佈出去。散佈類變更的前提是**變更已進 `origin/main`**——本地 branch 未 push
  時散佈等於空轉。
- 更詳細的專案事實（工具、腳本清單、SSH 架構、主機清單）見 root `CLAUDE.md`。
